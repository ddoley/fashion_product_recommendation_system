# Fashion Product Recommendation System
This project implements a Fashion Product Recommendation System that suggests similar fashion products based on an input image. The system leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and employs various machine learning techniques to train the model and generate recommendations effectively.

## Key Features
### 1.Image-Based Recommendations:
Users can upload an image of a fashion item, and the system recommends visually similar products.
### 2.Deep Learning with CNN: 
Utilizes CNNs for extracting robust features from images, ensuring high-quality recommendations.
### 3.End-to-End Pipeline: 
Covers the entire process from data preprocessing, model training, feature extraction, to generating recommendations.
### 4.Efficient and Scalable:
Built with scalability in mind, making it suitable for real-world applications like e-commerce platforms.
## Tools and Libraries Used
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (specify the one you used).
Image Processing: OpenCV, PIL, or other relevant libraries.
Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (if applicable).
Recommendation System: Cosine similarity, k-NN, or any custom algorithm for matching similar products.
## Workflow
1.Dataset Preparation:
Collected and preprocessed images of fashion products.
Labeled and categorized products for supervised training (if applicable). 

2.Model Training:
Trained a CNN model on the dataset to learn image features.
Fine-tuned or transferred learning from a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG, ResNet). 

3.Feature Extraction:
Extracted embeddings (feature vectors) from the trained model for each product image. 

4.Recommendation:
Used similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) to recommend products visually similar to the input image.
